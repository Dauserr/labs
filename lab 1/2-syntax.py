if 5>2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")
if 5>2:
        print("Five is greater than two!") # number of spaces is op to you, but ion every block of code they have to be equal
#if 5>2:
#        print("Five is greater than two!")
#            print("Five is greater than two!")     WRONG, since the number of spaces in one block is different

x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"

#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")
